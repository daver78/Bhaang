// Dave's Notes.  Largely ignore these.

Got BitBucket: 2Grz59RrptQDsjdZZZSh (for Da Vinci)

// dv.php
- dv.php?page=<pageName> â€¦ like page=homePage, pickAnObjective, etc., does a case (page) type thing
- If no page param is passed, load homePage.html.

// myLists.html
- For right now, name of List and XML portion defining the TA.  Shows a count.
- These lists appear anywhere we have a TO (like "Printer Prospects [1,523 Contacts]")

// homePage.html
- Jumbotron-style with big button that says "Create a Campaign"; goes to pickAnObjective.html
- Below, a ordered list of published Campaigns with EDIT button or link


// pickAnObjective.html
- List of Objectives as Cards for now
- "Promote a Blog Post" is the only working one for now; mimics what we do @ MF
- When Users hits "GO", they see nameYourCampaign.html 

// nameYourCampaign.html
- See a page that says "What do you want to call your campaign?"
- When User hits submit, we get the MAML template from S3 and Publish to Studio
- Then we Enable Editing, find the snippets in each of the Content Vars, and replace them with their new unique names. 
- For now, snippets are like:
email1-subject.html
email1-to.html
email1-body.html
- Once replaced, snippets can be like:
1444-13-email1-subject (accountID - programID - campaignID - ElementID-email1-subject.html

// editEmail.html
- At top of page, is <h1> Program Name
- Beneath that, 4 fields:
* SUBJECT:  email1-subject.html
* TO:       [Target Audience Pull Down]
* BODY:     email1-body.html
* SCHEDULE: Date picker
* Send Test Button
* Save

What Mac does: 
- A/B Split on first email to find winning subject for opens
- Non-opens, changed subject line
- Clickers, change body (and subject?)
